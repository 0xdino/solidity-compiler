# Solidity compiler

This repository provides a Solidity compiler implemented in TypeScript for easy use of the compiler inside applications.
And also inside the module there is a formatter for the code of smart contracts.

To install the necessary version of the compiler, install it via npm (by default is 0.8.19):

```shell
npm i solc@0.8.19
```

For the test run the command:

```shell
npm install
npm run test
```

This repository will be updated.
