# Solidity compiler

## About

This repository provides a Solidity compiler implemented in TypeScript for easy use of the compiler inside applications.
And also inside the module there is a formatter for the code of smart contracts.

To install the necessary version of the compiler, install it via npm (by default is 0.8.19):

```shell
pnpm add solc@0.8.19
```

For the test run the command:

```shell
pnpm i
pnpm test
```

This repository will be updated.

In the latest update, the ethers library has been added, which allows you to get adapted code for calling transactions in large smart contracts.
